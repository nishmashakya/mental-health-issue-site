# Mental Health (Issue Site)

As I learn more about creating websites, I wanted to make an issue site on a topic that holds a lot of significance for me: mental health. There is a lot of negative stigma around mental health and false preconceptions, so the goal of this site is to bring awareness to what mental health actually is, housing both information and resources.
